Schellings Model of Segregation

2. This program is a grid filled with coloured and blank squares. There are adjustable sliders to change the ratios 
of the number of each type of different square. Once the slider is moved the number of blocks and the ratios adjust
 in real time. The grid can be reset and the board size and delay time can also be adjusted. One of the features in 
 the program is to check to see if a specific block is satisfied. For a block to be satisfied the surrounding number
 of similar blocks to the one selected must match the percent similar. If it does not meet that percentage than it is 
 considered not satisfied.

3. No bugs that we know of.

4. Zach did the Initial Setup and customized the sliders, the remainder was done by pair programming taking turns typing and reviewing.
